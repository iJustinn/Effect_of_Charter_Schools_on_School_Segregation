# Introduction

This study delves into how people make decisions, feel about their choices, and, especially, how they deal with regret when things don't go as planned. Imagine taking a different route home and getting into a car accident. How much more would you regret these decisions just because they're not what you usually do? This idea stems from a concept called norm theory, which suggests that people feel extra bad about outcomes when they result from actions that are not typical for them.

This paper focuses on two main experiments to unravel this complex bundle of decisions and emotions. The first experiment places people in a scenario where they decide whether or not to pick up a hitchhiker, testing how much one would regret the decision based on whether it's something they normally do. The second experiment changes the setting to driving, where choosing a different route leads to an accident, and looks at how this break from routine affects their feelings of regret.

At the center of the investigation is the idea of exceptionality—making choices that break from people's usual patterns—and how this leads to stronger feelings of regret when things go wrong. This paper also explores whether people think that making an unusual choice (one they had full control over) makes them more responsible for the bad outcome, compared to if someone else made the decision for them or if it was just another day doing the same old thing.

This paper takes a closer look at the concept of free will in people's choices, whether they believe that they had the freedom to choose differently in situations they set up themselves versus those set up by others or by habit. This part of the study helps people understand better why one might blame themselves more when they voluntarily make a choice that leads to regret.

By picking apart these scenarios, this paper aims to shed light on the tricky relationship between stepping out of one's comfort zone in decision-making and the regret that can follow, especially when things don't turn out well. The goal of this research is to contribute to the broader conversation on how people's minds work in these situations, improving understanding of why people feel the way they do after making certain choices. This insight is not just for psychologists but for anyone interested in the little decisions people make every day and how they shape their feelings and lives.

# Data {#sec-data}

Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-bills), from @palmerpenguins.



# Model

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].



## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.
