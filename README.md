# Impact of past behavior normality on regret

## Paper Overview

This paper replicated the [research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2018.1504747) done by Lucas Kutscher & Gilad Feldman, about the impact of the impact of people's past behaviour on regret.
The comprehensive analysis was conducted using `R` programming and is presented as a final research paper in `PDF` format. The data is directly acquried from [research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2018.1504747).
