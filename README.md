# Impact of past behavior normality on regret

## Paper Overview

This paper replicated the [research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2018.1504747) done by Lucas Kutscher & Gilad Feldman, about the impact of the impact of people's past behaviour on regret.
The comprehensive analysis was conducted using `R` programming and is presented as a final research paper in `PDF` format. The data is directly acquried from [research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2018.1504747).

## File Structure

The files for this research are organized in the following ways:

-   `inputs/data`: the raw data used for analysis

-   `inputs/llm`: records of multiple conversations with Chat GPT that assisted in building this project

-   `inputs/literature`: the literature used as supporting evidence or as references in the final paper

-   `replication/figures`: replicated figures in the final paper

-   `replication/scripts`: scripts used in this research to generate figures, tables, and data testing

-   `replication/sketches`: sketches of the dataset and figures before replication

-   `outputs/paper`: files used to generate the paper, such as Quarto and bibliography files, as well as the research paper itself

There were some minor errors when submitting our reproduction, and here's the correction:
> The average reproducibility score across all 5 display items is 9 (on a scale from 1 to 10, where 5 and 10 represent reproducible from analysis and raw data respectively).
> Reproducibility of Display Items:

> Figure 1 - Proportions for perceived regret, injunctive social norms, descriptive social norms, and negative affect.: 9

> Figure 2 - Proportions for perceived regret and luck.: 9

> Table 1 - Counts and proportions for perceived regret, social norms, and negative affect.: 9

> Table 2 - Counts and proportions for perceived regret and luck.: 9

> Table 3 - Sample size, means, and standard deviations for victim compensation and regret.: 9
